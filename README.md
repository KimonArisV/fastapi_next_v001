# FastAPI RESTful API Development Project

<p> Welcome to a comprehensive project focusing on Python API development using FastAPI! In this project, I've built a feature-rich API covering fundamental concepts of API design, 
  database integration.</p> 
<!--   , testing with pytest, and establishing a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. -->

## Project Overview
<p>In this project i have gain experience with various tech stack inlcuding FAastAPI (inlduing routing), Docker (docker-compose, DockerHub, etc.), Postman, JWT tokens, OAuth2, SQL, 
  Relational Databases (Postgres, PgAdmin GUI), Alembic migration, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic, ORMs, middleware functionality for CORS Configuration, CRUD Operations, environment variables
</p>

## FastAPI
- Started with FastAPI
- Explored Path Operations and HTTP Requests
- Implemented Schema Validation with Pydantic
- Managed CRUD Operations and Storing Data
- Utilized Postman Collections for Request Handling
- Implemented Automatic Documentation with FastAPI
- Organized Python Packages and Project Structure

## Database Integration
- Explored Introduction to Databases
- Installed and Configured PostgreSQL
- Defined Database Schema and Tables
- Managed PostgreSQL with PgAdmin GUI
- Learned SQL Basics, Querying, and Modifying Data
- Implemented Database CRUD Operations
- Delved into Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)
- Set up SQLAlchemy and Database Models

## User Authentication
- Defined Pydantic Models and Response Models
- Implemented User Registration and Password Hashing
- Utilized FastAPI Routers and Configured Routes
- Used JWT Token for User Login
- Managed Token Creation and OAuth2 PasswordRequestForm
- Ensured Route Protection and Handled Expired Tokens
- Explored Postman Advanced Features for Testing

## Advanced Database
- SQL Relationship and Foreign Keys
- Implemented SQLAlchemy Relationships and Query Parameters
- Cleaned up Code and Managed Environment Variables
- Focused on User-specific Operations and Authorization

## Deployment
- Managed Database Migrations with Alembic
- Explored CORS Configuration and Git Basics
<!-- - Set up a Production Environment with NGINX
- Explored Dockerization and Docker Compose for Production
- CI/CD and GitHub Actions
- Implemented Testing Strategies and Set up Continuous Integration
- Explored Building Docker Images and Deployment to Ubuntu -->

<!-- 
## Testing
- Explored Testing in FastAPI
- Wrote and Ran Tests with pytest
- Utilized Parametrization and Testing Classes
- Managed Fixtures for Database Interaction
- Used TestClient for API Testing
- Handled Test Environments and Cleanup

## CI/CD Pipeline
- Covered CI/CD Concepts
- Set up GitHub Actions and Configured Jobs
- Managed Python and Dependencies in CI/CD
- Explored Environment Variables and GitHub Secrets
- Ensured Testing in the CI/CD Pipeline
- Practiced Building Docker Images and Deployment
